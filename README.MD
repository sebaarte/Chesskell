To build the project:
    cabal build

To run the project:
    cabal run -- <pvp> <color>

    where pvp and color are command line arguments. 
    Set pvp to "pvp" to play against a human, else you will play against an AI. 
    Set color to "w" to play the whites, else you'll play blacks.

A lot of parts of the project are un-optimized and un-implemented parts are left in order to prepare second part of the project.
